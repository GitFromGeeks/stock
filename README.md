Stock Market Search App

This Flutter application follows Clean Architecture principles and integrates Riverpod for state management, Dio for network calls, and Flutter Secure Storage for secure data storage.

ðŸš€ Features

User Authentication (Login API, Secure Session Management)
Stock Search (Fetch and display stock results)
Stock Details Page (Comprehensive stock information with graphs)

NOTE  : The Graph API for Stock was not working. Since it was returning 500 internal server error, I was unable to implement that.
